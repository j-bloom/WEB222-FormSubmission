# WEB222-FormSubmission
This is a website that validates form information with JavaScript

This was an assignment for web class when first learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
This static website takes information from a user and checks to ensure the fields are filled out correctly using HTML attributes and JavaScript.

Once the necessary fields are populated the form will allow you to submit the data to a default server that was provided.
